# When you add to this gtfiles list a header which comes from a
# directory belonging to another language (ie, C++ or ObjC), you need
# to also edit gengtype.cc adding a special rule for the header to
# avoid having the GC stuff from that header being added to gtype-cp.h
# or gtype-objc.h.
#
# cp2 does not have any of these special headers at the moment,
# but when adding the first one look examples from objc[p].

# Get the C++ FE's gtfiles list.  Do this in a subshell, so we can
# extract exactly the gtfiles var, but munge cp-lang.cc into cp2-lang.cc.

# At the moment no additions to the list, but when adding the one
# look examples from objc[p].

# Now add our special bits to it.  Please keep this list sorted.
